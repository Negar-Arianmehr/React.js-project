# React.js-project
I am learning React with this app.. This is part of a course of https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/lecture

Reacrjs is a JS library for building user interfaces.
If you consider the Netflix You can see it is easy to work with it, with good user interface, the transition happens pretty much instantly, we dont seem to wait for a new page to load. When we work with some website like Netflix, it might almost feel a bit like a mobile app, even though I am using the website. From bobile apps where use that we have smooth transition that is fun to use that app and things happen instantly. Then traditionally in website, when we, for example, clicked a link or a button, our request was sent to a server and new HTML page was sent back to the browser where then could be displayed. So maybe it has the latency where we wait to open a new page.
It is this request and response cycle, which we can break up with JavaScript, because JS is a programing language that allows us as a developer to run logic in the browser and can do things that manupulate what the user sees.
JS in the browser is able to manipulate to so-called Dom, the HTML elements that are rendered onto the screen. We can manipulate this with JS. That allows us to change what the users see without fetching a new HTML page. So we dont need to request a new HTML page just to present something different to the user. on the other hand When we use just JS we have to write code for every part, is called an imperative approach.
# Why ReactJS
So Reactjs as a JS library is an extra building block and it is alll about building modern reactive user interfaces for websites.
We want to use Reactjs because it makes building modern, rich, complex user interfaces easeir, with a higher level syntax, where we write code in a declarative way, in a declarative component-focused way, we define what we wanna have on the screen. That is why we use the thecnology or framworks like react.
